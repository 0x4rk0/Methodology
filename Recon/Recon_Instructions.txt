ASN (Autonomous System Number): Within the Internet, an autonomous system (AS) is a collection of connected Internet Protocol (IP) routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common, clearly defined routing policy to the Internet.
This will allow you to search by organization name, and find hosts.

Major organizations have an ASN assigned to it, within this ASN is registered IP addresses. Here are some example of ASN's(https://bgp.he.net/) :

Tesla Motors: AS394363, AS394161
Facebook: AS63293, AS54115, AS32934, etc

Once you search for an organization, you can search for IP ranges by clicking on "Prefixes v4 and v6". This will show CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing...The numbers with a /24 /8 /etc). Here, you will be able to use something like masscan to see what's alive. Masscan will be discused later.

Once I get a list of IPs, I will do a reverse whois lookup (https://reverse.report/)
