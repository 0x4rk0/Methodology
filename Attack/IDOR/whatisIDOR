Insecure Direct Object Reference (called IDOR from here) occurs when a application exposes a reference to an internal implementation object. Using this way, it reveals the real identifier and format/pattern used of the element in the storage backend side. The most common example of it (altrough is not limited to this one) is a record identifier in a storage system (database, filesystem and so on).
